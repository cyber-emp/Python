# Modules in python are simply python files with the .py extension.
# this implements a function.  Modules are imported using the import statement.
# importing from math_operations.py
# Modules provide an easy way to organize code into reusable components. They can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python files.

import math_operations

print(math_operations.add(5, 2))
